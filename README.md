# path_tracking_pid

## Overview

Path Tracking PID offers a tuneable PID control loop decouling steerting and forward velocity. The forward velocity is generated in an open loop fashion by using target velocities and accelerations.

ðŸ“– **For detailed technical documentation of the controller design, see [Controller Design Documentation](doc/controller_design.md)**

One of the tracking options uses a carrot of length l in front of the robot to determine the steering action based on the lateral error between the current Global Point (GP)  and the Control point (CP):

![Tracking carrot](doc/figures/tracking.png)

If a smooth path is provided, the controller has the option to track the path with the base_link directly instead of lagging behind a carrot. In this case a Projected Global Point (PGP) is computed as well which is tracked by the CP. In this mode, the yaw error can also be used as control input.

The PID contains two closed loops: Lateral and angular loops, and an open loop: Longitudinal. For non-holonomic robots, the lateral and angular loops can be combine to compute steering actions.

## Model Predictive Control

As an optional feature, we use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) concept to regulate the forward velocity. The user can specify a maximum desired error bound to track the path. Using the model of the robot plus the controller settings, a predicted path is calculated and if the error bound is violated, the forward velocity of the robot is decreased until the predicted path lies within acceptable bounds.

## Tricycle model

The tricycle model is supported as well.

It is assumed the front wheel is steered and driven. The steered wheel link (SL) can be asymmetrically placed with respect to the BL. Limitations of steering and actuation are also taken into account.
## Anti collision

When used as a plugin, Path Tracking PID uses the costmap (and the robot footprint from the costmap) for anti-collision. No evasive maneuvers will be preformed (sticking to the path is key). However when obstacles are detected in close proximity to the robot or in the direct line of direction of the robot, the forward velocity will be decreased. This results in safer velocities around obstacles. If an obstacle cannot be avoided or is too close to the robot, a standstill will occur and the navigation is cancelled.

The maximum velocity of the robot will be scale linear with the costmap values around or in path of the robot. One can use the inflation layers (or even social layers) to construct these gradients in the costmap.

## Usage

The path_tracking_pid is a plugin for [move_base_flex](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base_flex).

To run move_base_flex with path_tracking_pid plugin:

    roslaunch path_tracking_pid path_tracking_pid_mbf.launch

## Static parameters

* **`base_link_frame`** (string, default: `base_link`) Name of the base link frame.

* **`holonomic_robot`** (bool, default: `false`) True for an holonomic robot. --> Unmaintained, expect bugs

* **`estimate_pose_angle`** (bool, default: `false`) Whether to take the pose angles from the path directly or to estimate them form consecutive path poses.

* **`use_tricycle_model`** (bool, default: `false`) True for using tricycle model instead of differential drive.

## Configuring in RQT

Tracking_pid parameters are all available through (rqt_)dynamic_reconfigure. The main parameters are:
